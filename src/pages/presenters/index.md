Thank you for your interest in becoming a speaker at C++Now.

We have two categories of presentations at C++Now. Every year we release a <a href="/announcements/2017/12/2018-call-for-submissions/">Call for Submissions for the <i>regular program</i></a> which are 45 or 90 minutes. That CfS is now closed for C++Now 2018, but it isn't too late to become a presenter.

We also have <i>lightning talks</i>. Lightning talks are only five minutes long. This is a challenging length for a technical talk! We make a Call for Lightning Talks a few days before the conference and continue to accept submission after the start of the conference.

Before you submit your talk, please have a look at our [Submitter FAQ](/about/faq/#submitter-faq) and our [Speaker FAQ](/about/faq/#speaker-faq).

For more information about regular program submissions, contact the Program Chair: [program@cppnow.org](mailto:program@cppnow.org)

For more information about lightning talks, contact the Lightning Talk Chair: [lightning@cppnow.org](mailto:lightning@cppnow.org)

<!--After that, fill out the form below and we will review your submission.
