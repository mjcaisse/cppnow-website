Thanks for registering and congratulations, **you are going to C++Now {{site.current_year}}!**

You do not need to print or bring a ticket, but be prepared to show personal identification when you register. If you need to make an attendee substitution, please notify us as soon as possible.

Registration starts at {{site.registration_time}} in Aspen. We look forward to seeing you then.

In order to make the conference run as smoothly as possible, we want to present sessions in appropriately sized rooms and we are asking for your help. When the conference schedule is available, you will have the option of creating your personal schedule. Doing this will help us anticipate the audience-size requirements of each session.

Do not forget to make your [lodging arrangements](/location/lodging/). Other information about the conference is available on this website. The [attendee FAQ is here](/about/faq/#attendee-faq). If you have any questions, [contact the organizers](/about/contact/).
