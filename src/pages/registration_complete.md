Thanks for registering and congratulations, **you are going to C++Now {{site.current_year}}!**


Do not forget to make your [lodging arrangements](/location/lodging/). Other information about the conference is available on this website. Please read [the attendee FAQ](/about/faq/#attendee-faq).

Conference registration starts at {{site.registration_time}} at Aspen Meadows Resort. You do not need to print or bring a ticket, but be prepared to show personal identification when you register.

When you receive your invite from Sched.com, please accepte it, update your bio and photo, and complete your personal schedule. Your bio and photo make it easier for others to engage with and stay in contact with you. Your personal schedule gives us the information we need to put sessions in appropriately sized rooms, so you'll have a seat for the talks you want to attend.

For this year, the conference will provide refunds with no refund fee.

In the event that a registered attendee is not able to attend:
* Please constact the [C++Now Registrar](mailto:registrar@cppnow.org) as soon as possible.
* We can make an attendee substitution at any time, up to the start of the conference.
* We can credit a registration for next year (avoiding any increase in registration rates).
* {% if site.refunds_are_free %}For {{site.current_year}}, the organizers are waiving the refund fee. We can refund the registration entirely.{% else %}Refund requests are granted, with {{site.refund_fee}} fee deduction, until {{site.refund_deadline}}.{% endif %}

If you have any questions, [contact the organizers](/about/contact/).
