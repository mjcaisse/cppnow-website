C++Now has always been a small conference, with intimacy one of its most compelling features. We're not concerned about holding a smaller than normal conference. We believe the C++Now experience will not be diminished with a smaller crowd. **We will not cancel the conference solely due to low attendance or speaker withdrawals.**

Our sole concern is the safety of our attendees, our hosts, and the public. If holding this year's conference is a health risk, we'll cancel it. (Postponement is not an option.)

Conference organizers have no public health expertise and are not able to make such a determination, so we’ll cancel the conference only on the instruction or advice of the relevant authorities (the WHO, the CDC, etc.), the applicable governments, and our hosting venue.

**The conference organizers’ intent is to hold C++Now 2020 as planned**, but we cannot rule out a cancellation.

We know that this uncertainty may be a challenge for those planning to attend. However, we believe it is low risk for attendees to make travel arrangements now and cancel them later:

* Many airlines are waiving change fees for flights booked in March, including Delta, United, and Frontier, the main airlines which provide flights to Aspen.
* Our hotel, the Aspen Meadows, allows cancellations up to 14 days before the conference.
* This year, we will allow refunds of the conference registration fee for any reason with no questions asked up until the first day of the conference.

If at the time of C++Now 2020 you feel sick, or are worried that you might have been exposed, we encourage you to stay home. If you are already in Aspen, please stay in your hotel. Under these circumstances contact us and we'll refund your registration feel.

If you are a regular attendee and are not planning to attend this year due to health concerns, we’d appreciate it if you’d let us know.

We look forward to seeing you all in Aspen this May.
