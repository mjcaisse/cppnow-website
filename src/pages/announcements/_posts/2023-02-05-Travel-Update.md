C++Now 2023 Important Travel Update

We've updated our [Transportation page](/location/transportation/) with information about travel options.

It may be possible to schedule pre-conference flights as normal, but you will probably need to search for one-way, multi-city, or "hacker" fares, to see those flights.

The conference is arranging a *Boost Bus* leaving from Aspen Saturday 2023-05-13 08:00, stopping at the Vail/Eagle (EGE) airport, with a final destination of the Denver airport (DEN). You will soon be able to purchase a pass during [conference registration](/announcements/2023/01/2023-registration-is-open/).

We are asking the community to support each other with ridesharing and information about travel options.

If you'd like to be part of this discussion and/or offer or join a rideshare, please [join the C++Now Discord](https://discord.gg/UZWwKFa6rr). We have a public #rideshare-and-travel channel as well as a #public-discussion channel.

Revised 2023-02-05.
