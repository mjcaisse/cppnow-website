This year we have 3 tracks with 48 outstanding C++-focused presentations, including three keynotes, lightning talks in the evening, a "Future of Boost" panel, the "Library in a Week" hands-on workshop, and some special surprises to be announced soon.


If you're still on the fence about whether to [join us](/registration/), now is a good time to choose to attend!  Check out the [amazing conference schedule](/history/2023/schedule/), and the [attendee video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PMBGscQZdqk).  The venue has a hard attendee limit of 140 this year, and if the conference sells out (as it tends to do), your remaining option is to wait until 2024.
