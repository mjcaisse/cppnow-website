When times are tough you learn who your friends are.

The last year has been a tough for everyone, not least for C++Now. After much preparation, we had to cancel C++Now 2020 and transition to an online-only format for C++Now 2021. These were the best decisions for our community, but that doesn't mean that they were easy to make or easy to implement.

In order to provide the best possible online conference experience for attendees, we are using four different online systems with integration provided by our support team at [Digital Medium](https://events.digital-medium.co.uk/).

This has been made possible by the support of our Corporate Sponsors who have stood by the conference when we've needed their support the most. Our "metal" sponsors include **Bloomberg Engineering**, the **C++ Alliance**, **SonarSource**, **Unified Streaming**, **Ciere Consulting**, and **Quantlab**.

C++ is one of our core programming languages. We are constantly pushing the language to its limits because our code needs to be scalable, reliable and extremely fast -- especially since every millisecond counts in the finance industry. Our C++ experts build everything from low-level libraries and components to some of the most performant financial applications and trading systems in the world. They also contribute to the C++ standard.
