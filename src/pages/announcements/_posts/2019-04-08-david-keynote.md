David is a frequent speaker at C++Now, where he may be best known for his talks on advanced functional programming in C++.

In this keynote address, he will discuss the C++ Reflection TS, of which he is a co-author. He will answer the question _What is the C++ Reflection TS and what will it do for me?_ (Spoiler: A lot!) The talk will cover this exciting new language feature, demonstrates how it is used, and discuss the direction reflection is taking within the C++ standardization committee.

David is an active member of the C++ standardization committee where he is currently serving as project editor for the Reflection TS. His prolific software developments have included CAD/CAM, computer graphics, visual programming languages, web applications, computer vision, and cryptography. His interests include large-scale development, dependently typed languages, semantic domains, EDSLs, and functional reactive programming. His current research interests include dependently typed languages, semantic domains, EDSLs, and functional reactive programming.
