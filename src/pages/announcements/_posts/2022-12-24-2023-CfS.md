The C++Now 2023 Call For Submissions is now open!

We cordially invite all members of the C++ community, including first time submitters, to submit session proposals for the 11th annual C++Now Conference, to be held May 7st – 12th, 2023, in Aspen, Colorado.

C++Now builds upon the resounding success of previous BoostCon and C++Now conferences. We look forward to considering your proposals. You will be joining leading speakers from the entire C++ community in making C++Now 2023 better than ever.

<!--break-->

The C++Now Conference focuses on open source software C++ usage and development, and the evolution of the C++ language. The audience at C++Now includes:

- C++ and Boost users,
- Boost Library author and maintainers,
- C++ based Open Source Software & Libraries,
- C++ library and framework developers,
- C++ compiler and tooling developers,
- Individuals involved in the evolution of the C++ and other programming languages.

The program fosters interaction and engagement within and across those groups, with an emphasis on discussion and collaboration.

C++Now will be fully on-site in 2023, and our COVID-19 vaccination will adhere to local health authorities' requirements and guidance.  Please see our [COVID-19 policy](/about/COVID-19_policy) for more detail.

### Session Topics

C++Now sessions focus on the latest C++ standards (C++17/20/23) as well as anticipated future standards (C++26). Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

- The new C++23 standard
- New ideas and proposals for future C++ standards, such as C++26
- C++ experiences, commentary and best practices from across the industry
- Heterogeneous and embedded programming with C++
- C++ library design and development
- Boost C++ libraries (design, development, tooling)
- Concepts and generic programming
- Compile-time programming
- Advances in C++ compiler technology
- C++ tooling (refactoring, analysis, debugging, build systems, _etc_.)
- Designing for testability and testing best practices
- Use of modern C++ with cryptocurrencies or blockchain technologies
- C++ education and training
- Any other topics likely to be of great interest to C++ developers

Note:  Presentations tend to be on more advanced or expert C++ topics.  The typical audience member is medium to advanced level.

#### Other programming languages

We encourage submission of proposals regarding C++-related programming languages, and thier development.

#### Tool vendors

We actively encourage tool and service vendors to submit proposals about products related to Boost and C++ (compilers, libraries, tools, _etc_.). (We discourage proposals about marketing, but are always interested in technology and its applications.)

### Session Formats

Most C++Now sessions are 90 minutes long, but sessions can be either shorter (45 minutes) or longer (multiples of 90 minutes). For 90 minute or longer sessions, registration will be waived for one presenter. For shorter sessions, registration will be prorated.

Many sessions take the form of a traditional presentation with a slide deck and a single speaker, but other formats are encouraged and supported, such as tutorials, live demos, _etc_.

For a list of session formats, see the [Presenter Information page](/presenters/)

### Submitting a Proposal

Please read the [presenters ](/presenters/) and [FAQ](/about/faq) pages carefully before submitting to assure that you are aware of these changes. This applies to both first-time submitters and long-time submitters.

<span style="font-size:20px;"><strong>Note: All proposal submissions must be made through our [presenters page](/presenters/).</strong></span>

Submissions are considered for inclusion in the program by a peer review process.

Session materials will be shared with the C++ community on the C++Now website.

Note: Presenters must agree to grant a non-exclusive, perpetual license to publish materials submitted to C++Now, either electronically or in print, in any media related to C++Now/BoostCon.

For any questions about the submission process, please contact the Program Committee at <mailto:program@cppnow.org>.

### Proposal Advice

Looking for advice? The program committee and experienced speakers would be happy to provide early feedback your submission.  To learn more, please email us at <mailto:program@cppnow.org>. 

We've also added two new checkboxes on the submission form that allow you to explicitly volunteer for giving advice, or ask for early feeback on your abstract, title, and content.  Feel free to use either, in the case that you’re a first timer, or an experienced speaker. We are happy to help!
