C++Now 2020 conference organizers are announcing that **this year's conference is canceled**.

I want to thank everyone who has put so much effort into making the conference possible including everyone who made a [submission to be a presenter](http://cppnow.org/announcements/2019/12/2020-CfS/), everyone who applied to be a [Student / Volunteer](http://cppnow.org/announcements/2019/12/2020-call-for-student-volunteers/), the [Program Committee members](http://cppnow.org/about/staff/) who collectively wrote almost three hundred fifty reviews, and all the [conference staff and organizers](http://cppnow.org/about/staff/) who year after year do so much to make the C++Now magic happen.

I want to think the [corporate](http://cppnow.org/about/corporate_sponsors/) and [individual](http://cppnow.org/about/individual_sponsors/) sponsors who supported us generously and have stood by us loyally.

I want to thank the organizations that we rely on year after year to put on the conference, some of whom have been gracious about allowing us out of our contractual obligations at this difficult time.
* [Aspen Center for Physics](https://aspenphys.org/)
* [Aspen Meadows Resort](https://www.aspenmeadows.com/)
* [Bash Films](http://www.bashfilms.com/)
* [Krueger Event Management](http://www.kruegerevents.com/)

It is a disappointment that we'll not see you in Aspen this year.

But next year we'll be back better than ever and we'll see you all in **Aspen in May 2021**.
