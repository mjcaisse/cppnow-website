This year we have 3 tracks with over 50 C++-focused presentations including keynotes, lightning talks, panels, and the "Library in a Week" hands-on workshop.

If you are still on the fence about whether to [join us](/registration/), now is a good time to make up your mind. The venue has a hard attendee limit and if the conference sells out (as it tends to do), your remaining option is to wait until 2019.
