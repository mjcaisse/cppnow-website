### Wrapping up C++Now 2018 and announcing C++Now 2019

C++Now 2018 was an exhilarating experience for all attendees. The weather was perfect, both keynotes hit it out of the park, we had a lot of new faces, and the energy was fresh and exciting.

This post will announce the "Best Session" ballot winners, share some trip reports, and announce the dates and location for C++Now 2019.
