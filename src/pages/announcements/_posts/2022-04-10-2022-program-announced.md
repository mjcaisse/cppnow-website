This year we have 2 tracks with 34 outstanding C++-focused presentations, including two keynotes, lightning talks in the evening, a "Future of Boost" panel, and the "Library in a Week" hands-on workshop.


If you are still on the fence about whether to [join us](/registration/), now is a good time to make up your mind. Check out the [conference schedule](/history/2022/schedule/), and the [attendee video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PMBGscQZdqk).  The venue has a hard attendee limit of 100 this year, and if the conference sells out (as it tends to do), your remaining option is to wait until 2023.
