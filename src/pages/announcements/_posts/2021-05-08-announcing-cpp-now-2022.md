### Wrapping up C++Now 2021 and announcing C++Now 2022

C++Now 2021 was our first and only online conference experience. Attendees, many of whom are new to C++Now, enjoyed the *Gather Town* virtual environment. But the commonly expressed sentiment was a desire to be able to meet together in our Aspen home.

This post will announce the "Best Session" ballot winners and announce the dates and location for C++Now 2022.
