We invite you to submit session proposals to the 5th annual C++Now Conference (tenth annual BoostCon): C++Now 2016 (Aspen CO, USA, May 9 – 14, 2016).

Building upon the resounding success of previous BoostCon and C++Now conferences, C++Now 2016 will present leading speakers from the whole C++ community.

<!--break-->

The C++Now Conference is dedicated to discussion and education about C++, an open and free language and standard. Our Conference will focus on discussion and education about open source software usage and developments in the C++ developer and user community. To reflect the breadth of the C++ and Boost communities, the conference includes sessions aimed at three constituencies: C++ and Boost end-users, hard-core library and tool developers, and researchers pushing the boundaries of computation. The program fosters interaction and engagement within and across those groups, with an emphasis on discussion.

As a multi-paradigm language, C++ is a melting pot with the most compelling ideas from other programming communities blending in powerful ways. Historically, some of the most popular sessions at C++Now have highlighted these concepts, from DSLs to functional programming to transactional memory and more. Bring your C#, Python, Ruby or Haskell influences to bear in an environment that will broaden their exposure.

At C++Now 2016 we would like to focus on the now established C++11 and C++14 standards and how those standards shape C++’s future. However, by no means is this intended to restrict the topics of proposals we hope to see. Any other topic related to C++, as described below, is suitable for submission.

### Important Dates

* **January 29th** - Proposal submissions due *(Note this date cannot and will not be extended.)*
* **February 22nd** - Proposal decisions sent
* **March 14th** - Program online


### Best Presentation Awards

We know how much effort it takes to prepare talks for our conference. For this reason attendees vote on the best presentations of the conference. Each winner will receive a commemorative plaque and announcement on the C++Now website.


### Session Topics

Topics of interest include, but are not restricted to, the following:

* C++11/14 and how it changes life for users and library writers 
* New directions and proposal for upcoming C++ standards 
* Concepts and generic programming 
* Designing for testability 
* Using specific Boost libraries in-depth 
* Extending or enhancing existing Boost libraries 
* Advanced implementation techniques used within Boost libraries 
* The design and/or the development process 
* Software development tools and their application to C++ and or Boost 
* Boost infrastructure topics such as build tools, website, testing 
* Any other topics likely to be of great interest to C++ developers 
* Tools for better developer productivity

Interactive and collaborative sessions are encouraged, as this is the style of learning and participation that has proven most successful at such events. Sessions can be tutorial based, with an emphasis on interaction and participant involvement, or workshop based, whether hands-on programming or paper-based, discussion-driven collaborative work.


### Session Formats

* **Lectures* focus on a practitioner’s ideas and experience with anything relevant to the C++ community.
* **Panels* feature three or four people presenting their ideas and experiences relating to C++’s relevant, controversial, emerging, or unresolved issues. Panels_ may be conducted in several ways, such as comparative, analytic, or historic.
* **Tutorials* are sessions at which instructors teach conference participants specific skills or knowledge relevant to C++.
* **Workshops* provide an active arena for advancements in C++-relevant topics. Workshops provide the opportunity for experienced practitioners to develop new ideas about a topic of common interest and experience.
* **Tool Vendor Presentations* : We actively encourage tool vendors and ISP’s to submit proposals for a special _Tool Vendors Session Track_ aimed at products related to Boost and C++ (compilers, libraries, tools, etc.).
* Other formats may also be of interest. Don’t hold back a proposal just because it doesn’t fit into a pigeonhole.


### Submitting a Proposal

All submissions should be made through our [submission page](/submission/).

Standard sessions are 90 minutes. You may submit a proposal for fractions or multiples of 90-minutes. Fractional proposals will be grouped into 90 minute sessions. Longer sessions, such as tutorials and classes, will be assigned 90 minute, three hour (i.e. half day), or six hour (i.e. full day) time slots.

One registration fee is waived for a standard session presentation. Shorter sessions are prorated.

All submissions will go through a peer review process.

Session materials will be posted to the C++Now website and will be available to conference attendees.

For general information on the C++Now 2016 paper submission process or the scope of technical papers solicited, please refer to the conference website at cppnow.org. For any other questions about the submission process or paper format, please contact the Program Committee [cppnow2016@easychair.org](mailto:cppnow2016@easychair.org).

Note: Presenters must agree to grant a non-exclusive perpetual license to publish submitted materials, either electronically or in print, in any media related to C++Now.

C++Now is presented by Boost in-cooperation with ACM.
