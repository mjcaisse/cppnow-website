The C++Now 2021 Program Committee is pleased to announce that the [2021 Conference Schedule](/history/2021/schedule/) is now online.  We have a great, fully-online program this year with 3 tracks and 49 C++-focused sessions, including keynotes, regular sessions, library-in-a-week, lightning talks, and the traditional closing panel.  If you're still on the fence about whether to join us, now is the time to check out [the schedule](/history/2021/schedule/), last year's [attendee video](https://www.youtube.com/embed/qCnw4dSZNTM), and [join us](/registration/) now.
