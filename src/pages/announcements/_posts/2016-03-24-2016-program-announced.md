The [C++Now 2016 program](/history/2016/schedule/) is now online.

<!--break-->

This year's Call for Submissions resulted in a record number of submissions, so it is no surprise that we've completely filled all three tracks for this year's conference.

We have sessions from [dozens of speakers](https://cppnow2016.sched.com/directory/speakers). Many sessions feature popular returning speakers, including our keynote speaker, Sean Parent, but many sessions are from speakers presenting at C++Now for the first time.

As expected, the program features many sessions on C++14, performance, metaprogramming, and concurrency. In addition, we have sessions on open source, Boost, tools, portability, maintainability, refactoring, functional programming, coroutines, games, testing, documentation, reflection, and, of course, what to expect in C++17.

Our tenth annual conference is shaping up to be one of the strongest programs that we've ever offered. [Join us in Aspen this May](https://cppnow2016.eventbrite.com).
