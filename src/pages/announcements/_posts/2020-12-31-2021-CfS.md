The C++Now 2021 Call For Submissions is open! We invite all members of the C++ community, including first time submitters, to submit session proposals to the 9th annual C++Now Conference: C++Now 2021 (May 2 – 7, 2021). C++Now 2021 will be held <span style="color: red;">entirely online</span>.

C++Now builds upon the resounding success of previous BoostCon and C++Now conferences. We look forward to considering your proposals. You will be joining leading speakers from the entire C++ community in making C++Now 2021 better than ever.

<!--break-->

The C++Now Conference focuses on open source software C++ usage and development, and the evolution of the C++ language. The audience at C++Now includes:

- C++ and Boost users
- Boost Library author and maintainers
- C++ library and framework developers
- C++ compiler and tooling developers
- Individuals involved in the evolution of the C++ language

The program fosters interaction and engagement within and across those groups, with an emphasis on discussion.

### Session Topics

C++Now sessions should focus on the latest C++ standards (C++11/14/17/20). Topics of interest include, but are not restricted to:

- The new C++20 standard
- C++ experiences, commentary and best practices from across the industry
- New ideas and proposals for future C++ standards
- C++ library design and development
- Boost C++ libraries (design, development, tooling)
- Concepts and generic programming
- Compile-time programming
- Advanced in C++ compiler technology
- C++ tooling (refactoring, analysis, debugging, build systems, _etc_)
- Designing for testability and testing best practices
- Use of modern C++ with cryptocurrencies or blockchain technology
- Any other topics likely to be of great interest to C++ developers 

#### Tool vendors

We actively encourage tool vendors and ISP’s to submit proposals about products related to Boost and C++ (compilers, libraries, tools, _etc_). (We discourage proposals about marketing, but are always interested in technology and its applications.)

### Session Formats

Most C++Now sessions are 90 minutes long, but sessions can be either shorter (45 minutes) or longer (multiples of 90 minutes). For 90 minute or longer sessions, registration will be waived for one presenter. For shorter sessions, registration will be prorated.

Many sessions take the form of a traditional presentation with a slide deck and a single speaker, but other formats are encouraged and supported, such as tutorials, live demos, _etc_.

Most session will be delivered live, but pre-recorded sessions are all accepted.

For a list of session formats, see the [Presenter Information page](/presenters/)

### Submitting a Proposal

Because this year's conference is online, there are some important changes to the presentation process. Please read the [presenters ](/presenters/) and [FAQ](/about/faq) pages carefully before submitting to assure that you are aware of these changes. This applies to both first-time submitters and long-time submitters.

All submissions should be made through our [presenters page](/presenters/).

Submissions are considered for inclusion in the program by a peer review process.

Session materials will be shared with the C++ community on the C++Now website.

Note: Presenters must agree to grant a non-exclusive, perpetual license to publish  materials submitted to C++Now, either electronically or in print, in any media related to C++Now/BoostCon.

For any questions about the submission process, please contact the Program Committee <mailto:cppnow2021@easychair.org>.
