It is my pleasure to announce the fourth year of the C++Now Student/Volunteer program! We are again inviting students with an interest in C++ to attend the May 9-14, 2016 conference in Aspen, CO as Student/Volunteers.

<!--break-->

The Student/Volunteer program is an excellent way for students and young coders with an interest in C++ to learn about language and make lasting connections with the community.

        Attending has truly been one of the most inspirational moments of my life. I had the opportunity to learn, socialize and have a great time in general. I hope to attend this conference yearly now and make a lasting impact in the computer science community.

Student/Volunteers will receive free registration and a travel stipend for their hotel and airfare.

Volunteers will handle various tasks during the conference, such as assisting presenters, setting up presentation rooms, running A/V equipment and helping with the conference picnic.

Students from all fields of study are welcome to apply. However, this conference covers advanced C++ topics, and applicants should have ample experience with the C++ programming language and be familiar with general computer science topics.

Applications will be accepted until March 16th, 2016. Application decisions will be sent out by March 21st, 2016.

You can apply and/or learn more about the program and some of the students who have participated **[here](/about/volunteer_program/)**.
