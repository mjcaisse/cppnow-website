It is my pleasure to announce the ninth year of the C++Now Student/Volunteer program! We are again inviting students with an interest in C++ to attend the {{site.current_dates_formated}} conference in Aspen, CO as Student/Volunteers.

The Student/Volunteer program is an excellent way for students and young coders with an interest in C++ to learn about language and make lasting connections with the community.

        Attending has truly been one of the most inspirational moments of my life. I had the opportunity to learn, socialize and have a great time in general. I hope to attend this conference yearly now and make a lasting impact in the computer science community.

Student/Volunteers will receive free registration and a travel stipend for their travel and/or lodging.

Volunteers will handle various tasks during the conference, such as assisting presenters, setting up presentation rooms, running audio/visual equipment, and helping with breaks and the conference picnic.

Students from all fields of study are welcome to apply. However, this conference covers advanced C++ topics, and applicants should have ample experience with the C++ programming language and be familiar with general computer science topics.

Applications will be accepted until {{site.deadline_for_volunteers}}. Application decisions will be sent out by {{site.notification_for_volunteers}}.

You can apply and/or learn more about the program and some of the students who have participated **[here](/about/volunteer_program/)**.
