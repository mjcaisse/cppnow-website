This year we have 3 tracks with over 50 C++-focused presentations including keynotes, lightning talks, panels, and the "Library in a Week" hands-on workshop.

If you are still on the fence about whether to [join us](/registration/), now is a good time to make up your mind. Check out the [list of session tags](/taglist/), the [conference schedule](/history/2019/schedule/), and the [attendee video](https://www.youtube.com/embed/qCnw4dSZNTM). The venue has a hard attendee limit and if the conference sells out (as it tends to do), your remaining option is to wait until 2020.
