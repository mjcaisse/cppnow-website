Advanced language mechanisms in the Circle compiler improve the expressiveness of parameter packs, argument lists, overload resolution and control flow. Use these enhancements to write beautiful generic code: no template recursion, no deduction tricks and no lambda hacks. Member pack declarations, pack subscripts and slices, imperative arguments and deduced forwarding references stop the pain of template metaprogramming. New implementations of std::tuple, std::variant and std::mdspan demonstrate how to code from specification, working with the language instead of around it.

Sean Baxter is the author of the Circle/C++ compiler.
