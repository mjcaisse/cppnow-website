### C++Now 2021 Online

We are announcing C++Now 2021 which will be held entirely *online*.

This year represents an unprecedented opportunity for you to **engage with Boost Library authors**. We are extending a free registration invitation to all authors and official maintainers of Boost Libraries. We've never been able to do this at the onsite conference, so this promises to be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

Although it is impossible to replicate the amazing experience of C++Now *onsite*, we are confident that we can provide the type of engagement that we know our community has come to expect of C++Now. It won't be in Aspen, but it will a much-needed opportunity for C++ experts and enthusiasts from around the world to engage online.

The dates for this year's conference will be May 2nd to 7th, 2021.

Going online does mean that there will be changes, not all of which have been determined yet. We will have the high-quality presentations that you've come to expect, lots of opportunity to engage with other attendees, and, of course, lightning talks. Sorry no picnic this year.

Look for additional announcements about our [Call for Submissions](/announcements/2020/12/2021-CfS/), registration, and our [Student/Volunteer Program](/about/volunteer_program/).

We'll see you in May.
