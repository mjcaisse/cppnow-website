### Wrapping up C++Now 2019 and announcing C++Now 2020

C++Now 2019 was an exhilarating experience for all attendees. The weather was not always perfect (although it was for the picnic), all the _Compile Time Magic_ keynotes were well received, we had a lot of new faces, and the energy was fresh and exciting.

This post will announce the "Best Session" ballot winners, share some trip reports, and announce the dates and location for C++Now 2020.

### <a name="awards"></a>Best Session Winners

Announcing the results of the **Best Session** balloting by C++Now 2019 attendees.

In 2017, Tony van Eerd did so well in the Best Session balloting that the joke was that we'd have to start calling it the _Tony Awards_. But even Tony's memorable showing was bested this year by first-time attendee, Conor Hoekstra, who dominated the voting.

#### Best Presentation

C++Now 2019 wrapped up with the announcement of C++Now 2020.

The dates for next year's conference will be **May 3 - 8, 2020** and the location will again be the [Aspen Center for Physics](https://www.aspenphys.org/) in Aspen, Colorado (with some sessions at the adjacent [Aspen Institute](https://www.aspeninstitute.org/)). The [Aspen Meadows Resort](https://www.aspenmeadows.com/) will again serve as the official hotel for the conference.


### Big Thanks!

Thanks for helping make the program a success. The conference organizers would like to send a big thank you for a successful C++Now to all the speakers, the attendees, Patty Fox, the staff of the Aspen Center for Physics, the staff of Aspen Meadows Resort, the Program Committee, the Student/Volunteers, the conference planning committee, Software Freedom Conservancy, and, of course, all of our wonderful sponsors.
