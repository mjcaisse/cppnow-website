CMake has emerged as the dominant build manager for C++ projects and this year we have the original CMake author as our opening keynote speaker.

Bill Hoffman is a founder of [Kitware](https://www.kitware.com/) and currently serves as Chairman of the Board, Vice President, and Chief Technical Officer (CTO). He is the original author and lead architect of CMake, an open source, cross-platform build and configuration tool that is used by hundreds of projects around the world, and he is the co-author of the CMake reference, [Mastering CMake](https://www.amazon.com/Mastering-CMake-Ken-Martin/dp/1930934319).

<!--break-->
Bill's opening keynote address is entitled _CMake: One Tool To Build Them All_ and will give the history behind CMake and explain how it fits into the areas not specified by the C++ standard, enabling developers to take advantage of the rich C++ ecosystem. The talk will introduce users to important CMake features supporting the seamless building, testing and deployment of C++ across most computing platforms.

The talk is about how CMake fits into the C++ world. Bill will describe how CMake is more than just a build system, but a tool chain that transforms C++, C, Fortran, CUDA, and C# code into a final, shippable product.

The heart of CMake is the codification of the complex knowledge between the C++, C, and Fortran language standards, and the diversity of available compilers, linkers, archivers, packagers, run-time loaders, and operating systems. CMake's ability to encode translation and artifact unit dependencies, manage language levels and compiler parameters via usage requirements, and support the mixing of multiple languages seamlessly are all designed to support the driving purpose of CMake: "to build software everywhere, correctly, with the user’s preferred tools.”
