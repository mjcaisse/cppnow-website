We've updated our [Transportation page](/location/transportation/) with information about travel options.

Since most C++Now attendees arrive in Aspen via ASE, conference organizers are asking that individuals interested in attending C++Now 2022 to please complete this [brief survey](https://forms.gle/NxTAdyG8p8DqWSNHA).

We are asking the community to support each other with rideshares and information about travel options.

If you'd like to be part of this discussion, please [join the C++Now Discord](https://discord.gg/UZWwKFa6rr). We have a public #rideshare-and-travel channel as well as a #public-discussion channel.
