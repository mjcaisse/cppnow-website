We've updated our [Transportation page](/location/transportation/) with information about travel options.

Pre-conference flights are scheduled as normal, but it may be that you need to search for one-way, multi-city, or "hacker" fares, to see those flights.

The conference is arranging a *Boost Bus* leaving from Aspen 2022-05-07 08:00, stopping at the Vail/Eagle (EGE) airport with a final destination of the Denver airport (DIA).

We are asking the community to support each other with rideshares and information about travel options.

If you'd like to be part of this discussion, please [join the C++Now Discord](https://discord.gg/UZWwKFa6rr). We have a public #rideshare-and-travel channel as well as a #public-discussion channel.
