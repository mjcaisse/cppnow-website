This year's C++Now keynotes share a common theme that reflects our desire for new perspectives:

> What can C++ learn from other languages?

**Ali Çehreli**, the author of [Programing in D](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B019AQNQ96/), will explain the <em>Competitive Advantage with D</em>.

In addition to being the author of one of the most important books on D, Ali is the secretary and board member of The D Language Foundation.

D is a systems programming language with C-like syntax and static typing. It combines efficiency, control, and modeling power with safety and programmer productivity.

Ali's talk will give a general introduction of D, focusing mainly on its compile-time features like reflection, templates, code generation, conditional compilation, and user defined attributes; and present D as a time-saving software engineering tool suited for business requirements.

Because C++ is such a powerful language and because C++Now attendees are master users of it, it is hard to argue for a single feature of D that would make one prefer D over C++. We know that one can achieve almost any programming task in C++, D, or most other languages. Ali will explain that the killer feature of D is the whole package it delivers. The competitive advantage that D brings is that it makes it easier to achieve almost any task.

*Ali Çehreli is a Senior Software Engineer, Octarine Labs, Inc. He has been writing C, C++, and D for over twenty years at various networking companies in Silicon Valley.*

Our [previously announced keynote speaker](/announcements/2017/03/rust-keynote/), Nicholas Matsakis, will present <i>Rust: Hack Without Fear</i>.
