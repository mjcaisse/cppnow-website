The C++Now 2019 Call For Submissions is open! We invite all members of the C++ community, including first time submitters, to submit session proposals to the 8th annual C++Now Conference: C++Now 2018 (Aspen CO, USA, May 5 – 10, 2019).

C++Now builds upon the resounding success of previous BoostCon and C++Now conferences. We look forward to considering your proposals. You will be joining leading speakers from the entire C++ community in making C++Now 2018 better than ever.

<!--break-->

The C++Now Conference focuses on open source software C++ usage and development, and the evolution of the C++ language. The audience at C++Now includes:

- C++ and Boost users
- C++ library and framework developers
- C++ compiler and tooling developers
- Individuals involved in the evolution of the C++ language

The program fosters interaction and engagement within and across those groups, with an emphasis on discussion.

### Session Topics

C++Now sessions should focus on the latest C++ standards (C++11/14/17/20). Topics of interest include, but are not restricted to:

- The upcoming C++20 standard
- C++ experiences, commentary and best practices from across the industry
- New ideas and proposals for future C++ standards
- C++ library design and development
- Boost C++ libraries (design, development, tooling)
- Concepts and generic programming
- Compile-time programming
- Advanced in C++ compiler technology
- C++ tooling (refactoring, analysis, debugging, build systems, _etc__)
- Designing for testability and testing best practices
- Use of modern C++ with cryptocurrencies or blockchain technology
- Any other topics likely to be of great interest to C++ developers 

#### Tool vendors

We actively encourage tool vendors and ISP’s to submit proposals about products related to Boost and C++ (compilers, libraries, tools, _etc_). (We discourge proposals about marketing, but are always interested in technology and its applications.)

### Session Formats

Most C++Now sessions are 90 minutes long, but sessions can be either shorter (45 minutes) or longer (multiples of 90 minutes). For 90 minute or longer sessions, registration will be waived for one presenter. For shorter sessions, registration will be prorated.

Many sessions take the form of a traditional presentation with a slide deck and a single speaker, but other formats are encouraged and supported, such as tutorials, live demos, _etc_.

Interactive and collaborative sessions are encouraged, as this is the style of learning and participation that has proven most successful at these events.

- _Lectures_ focus on a practitioner’s ideas and experience with anything relevant to the C++ community.

- _Tutorials_ are sessions at which instructors teach conference participants specific skills or knowledge relevant to C++.

- _Workshops_ provide an active arena for advancements in C++-relevant topics. Workshops provide the opportunity for experienced practitioners to develop new ideas about a topic of common interest and experience. Workshops usually feature significant hands-on exercises.

- _Case Studies_ are reports on a particular project or projects that attempted something new and the results of the experience.

- _Panels_ feature several people presenting their ideas and experiences relating to C++’s relevant, controversial, emerging, or unresolved issues. _Panels_ may be conducted in several ways, such as comparative, analytic, or historic and usually feature interaction between participants as well as Q&A with the audience.

- _Demonstrations_ show attendees what a particular process, product, technique, or library is capable of and how it is best used.

- Other formats may also be of interest. Don’t hold back a proposal just because it doesn’t fit into a pigeonhole.

### Submitting a Proposal
All submissions should be made through our <a href="/presenters/">presenters page</a>.

Submissions are considered for inclusion in the program by a peer review process.

Session materials will be shared with the C++ community on the C++Now website.

Note: Presenters must agree to grant a non-exclusive, perpetual license to publish  materials submitted to C++Now, either electronically or in print, in any media related to C++Now.

For any questions about the submission process, please contact the Program Committee <mailto:cppnow2018@easychair.org> .
