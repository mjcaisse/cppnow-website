C++Now delivers both formal and informal content in a variety of ways.

# Formal

Our formal content includes keynote presentations by individuals that are shaping the way we think about what we do and inspire us to do it better.

Our [main program sessions](/schedule/) are ninety minutes long. This is longer than most conference sessions, but the expectation for C++Now sessions is that they dig deep and have time for discussion, comments, and questions.

At the other end of the length scale, we feature [Lightning Talks](/schedule/lightning.talks/) that last only five minutes. Since our attendees often have clever insights as well as sharpe wits, this is long enough to make a point is creative ways.

# Informal

Our formal content is the best C++ content in the world, but we don't think it is the best we have to offer. Attendees consistently report that the most valuable learning taking place at C++Now is from the informal content.

Every year we offer the _Library in a Week_ experience which is a unique opportunity to work with the top minds in our industry in solving real world problems using the best that C++ has to offer. This week-long hands-on workshop is an unmatched experience for learning how the best professionals in C++ attack tough challenges.

In addition to long sessions, the C++ schedule features long breaks because we know that often, the presentations are just launching point for the kind of discussions that make attendees come back year after year.
