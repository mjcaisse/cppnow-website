I\'ve spoken at C++Now a few times and it was always a great experience. Everyone was very welcoming and helpful. C++Now is a one of a kind conference. There are some great opportunities to make valuable connections with the leaders of the C++ community since all big IT companies and field experts are represented here. As well as there is a great ratio of speakers to attendees. It\'s the best conference to discuss advanced topics where the C++ language can be pushed to the limits. There is no idea, too extreme here! For me, it\'s a C++ highlight of the year! BTW Aspen is an amazing place, it\'s a must see!</p>

C++Now is by C++ experts, for C++ experts - but don’t let that put you off - it’s not elitist! Instead it is an intimate and friendly gathering of those that take C++ seriously and want to move it forward. While the talks are some of the best, and most in-depth, you’ll find - it’s the times between and after the talks that the magic really happens - perhaps more than any other conference. With such a fantastic location this is as much a week-long retreat as a conference.</p>

        I have attended C++ Now every year since the inaugural 2012 conference. It certainly has been the high point of my professional calendar every year. No where else can you mingle with best and the brightest of C++ world. Every year I have brought something back that was immediately usable in my daily work. The venue and conference organization is superb. I am already looking forward to next year.

I have attended C++Now three years in a row so far, and I cannot recommend it enough.

Other than making many new friends and networking with amazing people, I've always found the content of C++Now  top-notch: most of the talks at the conference are engaging, controversial, and innovative in one way or another. It's not your usual "lecture"-style talk - audience participation is encouraged... and the audience is full of experts.

Whether it's sunny or heavily snowing, the view in Aspen is consistently beautiful and there are many fun activities to keep you busy after conference hours, including a picnic with all the attendees!

Definitely the best conference experience I've had so far.</p>

C++Now is my favourite conference, it is my can't miss event of the year (C++ or otherwise!).
There is something about the people who attend, and something about the place itself.
No other event has C++Now's combination of enticing ideas mixed with peaceful serenity.<br /><br />
words and thoughts swirling<br />
blossoms on the Aspen trees<br />
new ideas sprout<br />

        C++Now was an incredible experience. The talks are all world class and Aspen is a lovely town, but the best part for me was the people. I've watched a lot of recordings of talks, so when I got there I already felt like I knew many of the other attendees. Everyone I talked to had great insight and was working on interesting projects or libraries. Since roughly 1/3rd of the attendees were speakers some of them always happened to be around too. It felt almost as though I were at some exclusive event for famous c++ people, but everyone was so friendly and welcoming that I felt like I belonged there too. It was also a great opportunity for personal development. Some people pushed me to do a lightning talk, and from there I've gone onto have a full length talk accepted to CppCon, which I probably wouldn't have even submitted if it weren't for my experience at C++Now. In that sense I grew as a person as a direct result of my experiences at C++Now.
