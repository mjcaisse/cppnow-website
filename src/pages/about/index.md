        I have attended C++ Now every year since the inaugural 2012 conference. It certainly has been the high point of my professional calendar every year. No where else can you mingle with best and the brightest of C++ world. Every year I have brought something back that was immediately usable in my daily work. The venue and conference organization is superb. I am already looking forward to next year.

        With a welcoming, collaborative, and ruthlessly technical atmosphere, C++Now caters to library designers, compiler nerds, mailing list junkies, and anyone interested in pushing the envelope of what is possible in modern C++. This is the coolest tech conference in the world.

        C++Now was an incredible experience. The talks are all world class and Aspen is a lovely town, but the best part for me was the people. I've watched a lot of recordings of talks, so when I got there I already felt like I knew many of the other attendees. Everyone I talked to had great insight and was working on interesting projects or libraries. Since roughly 1/3rd of the attendees were speakers some of them always happened to be around too. It felt almost as though I were at some exclusive event for famous c++ people, but everyone was so friendly and welcoming that I felt like I belonged there too. It was also a great opportunity for personal development. Some people pushed me to do a lightning talk, and from there I've gone onto have a full length talk accepted to CppCon, which I probably wouldn't have even submitted if it weren't for my experience at C++Now. In that sense I grew as a person as a direct result of my experiences at C++Now.
