## C++Now Vaccine and Mask Policy

We continue to monitor mask requirements issued by the Pitkin County Health Department.  There is currently no mask mandate for events in Pikin County.  However, this could change, and if it does, we will let you know as soon as possible.

In 2023, with high vaccination rates and many events reopening, we are happy to be able to relax our COVID-19 policy as follows:

- For unvaccinated attendees: We respectfully request that you please wear a mask at all times while attending sessions and events at C++Now.

- For vaccinated attendees: Wearing masks is encouraged, but not required. No proof of vaccination is needed to attend.

- Complimentary masks will be available on-site.

- For all attendees: By attending C++Now, you are confirming that you are not displaying cold or flu-like symptoms and that you have not been exposed to or tested positive for COVID-19 within the past five days. If you do not meet these requirements, do not attend the conference, and instead contact the registrar for information about registration refunds.

Note: International travel requirements are separate from conference entry requirements; please consult the applicable government authorities for current travel requirements between your country to/from the United States. Information on the rescinding for testing for entering the US can be found [here](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/covid-19_testing_required_US_Entry.html).
