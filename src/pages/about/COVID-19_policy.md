## C++Now Vaccine Policy

To attend C++Now 2022, attendees must be fully vaccinated for COVID-19 with any WHO-approved vaccine. Fully vaccinated means two weeks have passed since your final vaccine dose.

To receive your badge, you can show an official proof-of-vaccination document online in advance using the link below, or at registration when you arrive.

Confirming online in advance of the conference saves time by streamlining the onsite registration process (and reduces the risk of showing up without your documentation). [Confirm vaccination status online](https://forms.gle/nM1kKabWg2RJULpw8).

Online confirmation requires you to upload a (potentially redacted) scan of your vaccination documentation, but after confirmation is complete, your uploaded scan is immediately deleted.

Please note that international travel requirements are separate from conference entry requirements; please consult applicable government authorities for current travel requirements between your country to/from the United States.

## Mask Policy
We continue to monitor mask requirements issued by the Pitkin County Health Department.  There is currently no mask mandate for events in which 100% of participants are fully vaccinated.  However, this could change, and if it does, we will let you know as soon as possible.
