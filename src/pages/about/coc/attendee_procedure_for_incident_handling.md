If you are a C++Now attendee and you are being harassed, notice that
someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please follow do
the following:

**1. Make sure everyone is physically safe.** If there is a threat to anyone's
physical safety, including yourself, summon security or law enforcement. Local
law enforcement can be contacted by calling 911. If you do not have a cell
phone, you can use any venue phone or ask a conference staff member for
assistance. If everyone is physically safe, involve law enforcement or security
only at a victim's request. 

**2. Inform the Security team of the incident.** Contact
Bob Steagall (Conference Chair) and the conference security team by emailing 
[security@cppnow.org](mailto:security@cppnow.org) and inform them that an
incident has occurred. All conference staff are familiar with the code of
conduct and incident reporting procedure, and can assist you in contacting
these individuals. 

**3. Report the details to the Security team.** Provide
Bob and the security team with a report describing the incident, preferably by
email. All reports are confidential.

Try to gather as much information as available, but do not interview people
about the incident. The conference staff will assist you in collecting
information and writing the report.

The report should include the following important:

- The name(s) or description(s) of the individual(s) doing the harassing.
- The name(s) or description(s) of any other individual(s) involved in the
    incident.
- The behavior that was in violation.
- The approximate time and location of the incident.
- The circumstances surrounding the incident.

After a report has been made, the conference staff will evaluate and respond to
the incident.
