C++Now 2017 was the second time when I participated in the C++ conferences.

### After I was selected

Looking at the profiles of the other [volunteers](https://cppnow2017.sched.com/directory/volunteers) I found a number of very curious and useful links. The ones that attracted my attention most were [Modern C++ Language and Library Features](https://github.com/AnthonyCalandra/modern-cpp-features) by [Anthony Calandra](https://cppnow2017.sched.com/volunteer/anthony278) and [Type-Safe Programming](https://foonathan.net/blog/2016/10/11/type-safe.html) by [Jonathan Muller](https://cppnow2017.sched.com/volunteer/boostcon.2017.jonathan.mueller_foonathan.net) (he also gave a [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iihlo9A2Ezw) on that subject).

### Before the conference

During my ride-share trip from Denver, CO to Aspen, CO I got acquainted in person with [Louis Dionne](https://cppnow2017.sched.com/speaker/louis_dionne) - the author of [Boost.Hana](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_66_0/libs/hana/doc/html/index.html) library, and his colleague - the conference speaker [John McFarlane](https://cppnow2017.sched.com/speaker/cppcon.2016.john_mcfarlane.name).

### During the conference

I got acquainted with another Russian-speaking volunteer - [Alex Zaitsev](https://cppnow2017.sched.com/volunteer/zamazan4ik) - who by his second year at the university was writing in C++ for the 7th year, who was actively contributing to the [Boost.Algorithm](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_66_0/libs/algorithm/doc/html/index.html), was participating in the C++ conferences in Russia and Belarus, and was involved in C++ standardization activities in Russia.

In one of the talks I saw closer the JetBrains product - [CLion](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/) - and met [Anastasia Kazakova](https://cppnow2017.sched.com/speaker/anastasia.kazakova) and [Dmitry Kozhevnikov](https://cppnow2017.sched.com/travel14) who work there (in St. Petersburg office in Russia).

One night I was surfing through the links from one of the talks. I bumped into the Scott Meyers' blog "[The view from Aristeia](http://scottmeyers.blogspot.com/)". [One of the posts there](http://scottmeyers.blogspot.com/2017/02/by-numbers-great-foreign-edition-book.html) has triggered my (so far) largest and most exciting contribution to the C++ Community - the C++ Video Captioning and Translation Initiative [cppvap.wikidot.com](http://cppvap.wikidot.com/) - which has resulted in my CppCon 2017 talks ([this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQudpkiQ2RA) and [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8QHpRAuf2A)) and I believe has played not the last role in getting all the CppCon 2017 talks [professionally captioned in English](https://cppcon.org/inclusiveness-accessibility-and-cppcon-2017-videos/).

During the socializing events I talked to a number of people, had a chance to listen to the discussions of standardization topics, instruments, ideas, etc.

### After the conference

On my return ride-share to Denver I was talking for 4 hours with the conference speaker [Charlie Bay](https://cppnow2017.sched.com/speaker/bay_charles).


During the whole conference I was watching the organizers, mostly [Jon Kalb](https://cppnow2017.sched.com/speaker/sched23), I saw how the internal mechanisms of the conference work, how Jon communicated with people. That gave me certain knowledge and raised my confidence in case I need to organize the C++ activities, events, meet-ups, etc. at my work or somewhere else.

Having my volunteering experience in C++Now 2017 (and CppCon 2016) I was offered a position of the Volunteering Shift Leader and Surveys Co-Chair at CppCon 2017. After that I was suggested to be the Speaker Liaison for CppCon 2018 and currently I'm doing that work for C++Now 2018 too.

One company in Russia got very interested in my experience with C++ conferences. Now we are discussing how I can help them to get to the US conferences, how to work around the language barriers, to optimize the expenses, etc.

To summarize, C++Now is

* Connections to the outstanding members of the C++ community from all over the world,
* Strong engineering growth,
* Horizons broadening,
* Experience and confidence,
* **Big opportunity**,
* Fun,
* and much more.

See you at C++Now!
