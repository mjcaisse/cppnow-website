The C++Now Volunteer/Student Program was started in 2013 in an effort to encourage student involvement in the C++Now conference and the C++ community. Each year, the conference helps a small group of young programmers attend the conference. In exchange, the students help the C++Now staff in running the conference. Volunteers assist with various on-site tasks, such as recording sessions, escorting keynote speakers, and setting up breaks and the conference picnic. Volunteers are able to attend most sessions and receive a waiver of their registration fees. Some stipends for travel-related expenses are available.

    <p class="quoteBoxText">
        Every night staying up until 12 or 1 AM in the morning talking about C++, techniques, experiences and ideas was entirely well worth it. It is rare I get to geek out in personâ€¦ and I got to do a whole week of it in beautiful Aspen!

        I went through the job interview cycle for my upcoming internship, and during the process I was asked numerous times about C++Now and my experience. An employer even emailed me mentioning how much of a differentiator it was to list on my resume!

        Attending has truly been one of the most inspirational moments of my life. I had the opportunity to learn, socialize and have a great time in general. I hope to attend this conference yearly now and make a lasting impact in the computer science community.
