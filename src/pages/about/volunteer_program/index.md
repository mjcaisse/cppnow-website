The C++Now Volunteer/Student Program was started in 2013 in an effort to encourage student involvement in the C++Now conference and the C++ community. Each year, the conference helps a small group of young programmers attend the conference. In exchange, the students help the C++Now staff in running the conference. Volunteers assist with various on-site tasks, such as recording sessions, escorting keynote speakers, and setting up breaks and the conference picnic. Volunteers are able to attend most sessions and receive a waiver of their registration fees. Some stipends for travel-related expenses are available.

        All of the attendees had knowledge to share. Although the talks can be seen online, nothing can compare to being surrounded by over a hundred C++ enthusiasts.
