The C++Now Volunteer/Student Program was started in 2013 in an effort to encourage student involvement in the C++Now conference and the C++ community. Each year, the conference helps a small group of young programmers attend the conference. In exchange, the students help the C++Now staff in running the conference. Volunteers assist with various on-site tasks, such as recording sessions, escorting keynote speakers, and setting up the conference picnic. They are able to attend most sessions. Volunteers receive a waiver of their registration fees and stipends for travel-related expenses are provided.

Applications will be accepted until March 20th, 2017. Application decisions will be sent out on March 27th, 2017.

        Attending has truly been one of the most inspirational moments of my life. I had the opportunity to learn, socialize and have a great time in general. I hope to attend this conference yearly now and make a lasting impact in the computer science community.

        All the talks were thought provoking, serving to further my understanding of the capabilities of C++ as well as to make me aware of how much there is to be learned.

        All of the attendees had knowledge to share. Although the talks can be seen online, nothing can compare to being surrounded by over a hundred C++ enthusiasts.

        I learned a lot about C++ that I thought I already knew, met a lot of cool and knowledgeable people, and more than anything, returned with a new confidence and appreciation for the language.
