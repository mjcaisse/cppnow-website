### Attendee FAQ

#### Why Aspen?

It's an understandable question: when some people think of Aspen, they see a glitzy skiing and shopping playground for the rich. But this town has another side that's in many ways stronger and more fundamental: a tradition of fostering intellectual and artistic collaboration. Every year the [Aspen Institute](https://www.aspeninstitute.org/), [Music Festival](http://www.aspenmusicfestival.com/), and [Center for Physics](https://www.aspenphys.org/) draw the most talented people in the world to work together. They come, not just because their colleagues are there, but because Aspen has an elusive quality that inspires great moments.



#### Why the long breaks?

Think back to the conferences you've been to. If your experience is like ours, the parts that really stick with you happen between scheduled conference sessions, meeting new people and working with old friends. We wanted to build in time for these serendipitous moments that only happen on the side at other conferences. Also, we thought it was important that attendees have an opportunity to enjoy the natural surroundings and scenery during the best part of the day, rather than being stuck inside a darkend room with an LCD projector.
  


#### What should I do after I register?

* Tweet (#CppNow), blog, or otherwise let everyone know you are coming.
* Make your travel arrangements. Sooner is better because that is when you'll have the best selections.
* Make your [hotel arrangements](/location/lodging/). Sooner is better because the hotel will sell out.
* Join the [CppLang Team on Slack](http://cpplang.diegostamigni.com/) and then the [#cppnow channel](https://cpplang.slack.com/messages/C59UQL3CL).



#### Why should I use Sched.com?

After you register, you'll get an invite from Sched.com. Accept this and use it to do two things.

* Fill out your bio and upload a photo. The most valuable part of C++Now is the opportunity to meet the other attendees. When everyone updates their bios and uploads their photos, it makes it easier for all of us to get to know each other.
* Fill out your personal schedule. This is not only convenient for you, it is very important for the conference. We use the personal schedule information to decide which session goes in which room.



#### What should I pack?

Springtime in the high Rockies has unpredictable weather. Check your favorite weather forecast and then don't believe it. Pack to dress in layers, preparing for sunny and warm and for wet and cold. The air is thin and the altitude is high. This means the sun is stronger than you think. Bring a hat, sun glasses, and sun screen. (The altitude affects your hydration levels. Be sure to drink water regularly to avoid dehydration.)

Comfortable shoes are highly recommended as downtown Aspen is over a mile away and the shortest distance from the resort to the Physics Center is through the meadow (which may be muddy).

A flashlight will be handy when returning from late sessions.

Don't forget to bring your business cards and laptops. There is wifi available at both the [Aspen Institute](https://www.aspeninstitute.org/) and the [Aspen Center for Physics](https://www.aspenphys.org/), but an ethernet cable and/or thumb drive may come in handy.



#### What should I do when I arrive?

Stay hydrated.

Check in on the [#cppnow channel](https://cpplang.slack.com/messages/C59UQL3CL) to let other attendees know you've arrived and see what others are doing. If you've arrived early, you may have a chance to join a group going to eat or just hanging out at the Meadows.



#### What happens at registration?

Registration is scheduled for two hours and it takes all of that time.

You'll get your badge and (usually) some swag and/or information.

Tours are organized to take first-timers around the conference campus so you'll know where everything is.

Why does this take two hours? Because the real purpose of registration is to get acquainted or re-acquainted with other attendees. You'll be meeting old friends and friends that you don't know yet. Other attendees are the real reason to attend C++Now, so get started early. (Don't wait until registration starts to show up for registration.)



#### Where do people socialize?

During the day, people usually go to lunch and dinner in groups. Don't be shy. If you see a group heading out, invite yourself along.

After the evening session, the Meadows bar always attracts a crowd.



#### What are Lightning Talks?

Lightning Talks are five minutes talks that are open to any attendee. They tend to be more light-hearted than serious, but not all are light-hearted and you can give one on any subject you want to talk about. You can wait until you arrive at the conference to ask to give one. (Some talks are in response to a keynote or other talk at the conference.) When you know that you'd like to speak and what you'd like to speak about, send an email with your talk title to the [Lightning Talk Chair](mailto:lightning@cppnow.org).



#### What if I can't decide what sessions to attend?

Then we've done our job. If there is only one talk you want to see in any timeslot, then we'd be disappointed in ourselves (and surprised). That is why we record all our sessions and put them on [our YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/BoostCon). You can also find [presentation slides online](https://github.com/boostcon).



#### How do I give speaker feedback?

The best way to give speaker feedback at a conference as intimate as C++Now is talk with speakers about their presentation. This is a favorite subject of speakers and is likely to make more of an impression than anything else you can do.

You can also vote for your favorite sessions. There are Best Session and Best Lightning Talk ballots that will be handed out and collected toward the end of the conference.

You can also give feedback using the feedback system on Sched.org. This may be an easier way to give negative feedback. Negative feedback is valuable, as long as it is constructive.



#### What is the planning meeting?

On the last evening of the conference, we'll have a meeting that is the kick-off meeting for the next year's conference. 

If you'd like to share some thoughts on what the conference organizers did right or did wrong, or if you'd like to help make the conference happen, please join us.

This meeting is open to anyone and represents an opportunity to make a contribution to the C++ community.



#### What is the Program Committee?

The Program Committee is the group of individuals that evaluate every submission to present at C++Now.

You can find information about the role of the committee in the [C++Now Program Committee Reviewers' Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Z1PXETemPj0FP_i_zqt1YFHK4KiFYAiGTvbpVa2kKE0/edit).

If you'd like to join the PC, please [contact the PC Chair](mailto:boostcon-pc-chair@googlegroups.com).



#### Code of Conduct

We use the [PyCon Code of Conduct](https://us.pycon.org/2016/about/code-of-conduct/). For any questions or concerns, [contact our Security Team](mailto:security@cppnow.org) or [contact Jon Kalb](mailto:jon@cppnow.org), our Conference Chair, directly.



#### What can I do to support the conference?

C++Now is a community conference and it survives because of the support of the community. You support the conference when you:

* attend
* tweet, blog, or otherwise talk about the conference with other C++ developers
* make a presentation submission
* give a lightning talk
* join [the Program Committee](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Z1PXETemPj0FP_i_zqt1YFHK4KiFYAiGTvbpVa2kKE0/edit)
* attend the planning meeting
* join [the planning list](https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!forum/boostcon-plan)
* volunteer to take on a conference-related responsibility
* recruit attendees, speakers, PC members, Student / Volunteer applicatants
* get your company to [be a sponsor](/about/corporate_sponsors/)
* become a [Boost Scholarship Sponsor](/about/individual_sponsors/)
* write a trip report about the conference (send link [to the planning list](mailto:boostcon-plan@googlegroups.com))
* write a testimonial about the conference (send link [to the planning list](mailto:boostcon-plan@googlegroups.com))



### Submitter FAQ

#### What are the elements of a good submission?

* Consider your audience. The Program Committee judges proposals based upon how interested C++Now attendees are likely to be in the content. The more niche your content, the less interest there will be, which increases the likelihood your presentation will be rejected.
* Focus on topics about which you are knowledgeable and passionate.
* Choose a short, punchy title that clearly states the purpose of the presentation. Clever titles can grab attention, but cutesy titles may do the opposite.
* Try to write just one sentence to describe your presentation. As with documenting classes or functions, if you can't boil down the description, you're likely doing too much in one presentation.
* Consider describing a challenge, problem, or situation you will address and then discuss how you will address or solve it.
* Provide enough details to allow the reviewing to make an informed decision. The less well known you are to the reviewer or community, the more you have to show that you know the material, can organize a good presentation, and can interest the audience.
* C++Now is a technical conference, so discussions of management problems, while not uncommon, are not appropriate.
* Intentions to present on what does not yet exist increases the risk of rejection. For example, if you intend to present a library, don't expect the Program Committee to take on faith that you'll create that library and a good presentation by the time of the conference.
* Overly simplistic subjects will almost certainly be rejected.
* Don't underestimate your time requirements. If you are unused to technical presentations, then five minutes is a lot longer than you think and forty-five minutes is a lot shorter than you think.



### Speaker FAQ

#### Will there be a digital video projector available?

Yes.



#### Will there be an audio system available?

Yes.



#### Will there be a computer available?

No, please bring your own or arrange with the program committee to get access to one.



#### Do I have to use PowerPoint?

No. OpenOffice.org's Impress and Apple's Keynote are popular alternatives.



#### What are some of the elements of a good presentation?

Take a look at [Doug Gregor's Google Tech Talk presentation](https://youtu.be/oZhixOWljWI).

Suggestions from experienced presenters include:

* Think about who your audience is, and target your talk toward the middle of that audience. Boost users, for example, are C++-literate and can be assumed to know about Boost in general, so concentrate on the Boost library you are presenting.
* Your audience can read, so don't just stand there and read your slides to them. Explain the bullet points or code examples on your slides. Give the rationale behind the design. Relate new material to things they are already familiar with.
* Do include code examples; C++ programmers often understand code examples better than prose descriptions.
* Look at your audience. Make eye contact.
* Repeat questions from the audience before answering, particularly with a larger audience where not everyone may be able to hear other audience members.
* Don't just tell your audience what something is, tell them how to use it themselves. Show them real code.
* Involve your audience; ask them questions.



#### How many people will attend my session?

Given the capacity of the rooms, plan on a maximum of 100 and a minimum of 20.



#### How much time should I reserve for questions?

This can vary from speaker to speaker and topic to topic, but something of the order of 10 minutes for a 90-minute session. You can take questions as they arise, leave them until the end (or, for long sessions, just before the next break), or a mix of both, but be sure to let the audience know at the beginning if you are happy to take questions as they come or whether you prefer to leave them until the end. Of course, if you are involving the audience by asking them questions, you should expect questions in return during the session. In taking questions during the session, try to be brief and to not get sidetracked. If a question deserves a longer answer than the flow of the material allows, or is a little off topic, say so and suggest coming back to it either at the end or offline.



#### How can I tell how long my presentation will take?

It depends on the amount of detail on each slide, the amount of time allowed for questions, any time budgeted for demos, and, of course, the typical slide velocity of the presenter. If you are unsure, it is worth rehearsing all or part of your presentation to get a sense of the timing. Different presenters have different average slide velocities: some presenters use only a few slides, and move to a new slide once every five minutes or so; others move through their slides at a rapid rate, up to once every minute or so. Work out where you are on this scale and determine a slide limit based on the duration of your session divided by your typical slide velocity.



#### Can I compile/run stuff, or must everything be on slides?

Running compiles or demos can add interest, but be very sure the app will work! Live demos are notorious failure points. There is nothing sadder that attending a presentation designed around a live demo that the presenter can't get working.



#### What material should I provide to be distributed to attendees?

At the minimum, provide a PDF file of your slides.



#### Must I stay in the conference hotel?

No, although part of the fun and benefits of a conference come from offline interactions with attendees in informal settings such as the hotel bar. :-)



#### When should I plan to arrive?

At a minimum, please plan to arrive the day before your session, and allow plenty of leeway for travel delays. And of course we hope you will come for the entire conference, and leave some time to enjoy the spectacular setting.
