## Boost Scholarship Fund

The Boost Scholarship Fund supports two programs that directly benefit C++ students and indirectly benefit the entire C++ community: Boost Summer of Code and the C++Now Volunteer/Student Program.


### Boost Summer of Code

The BSoC program is modeled after the [Google Summer of Code](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/) program, in which Boost is a long time participant. Like GSoC, BSoC projects provide funding for students to work on specific Boost Library projects over the summer. BSoC is designed to supplement the GSoC program by allowing Boost to accept students that would otherwise be rejected by GSoC due to funding or eligibility.



### C++Now Volunteer/Student Program

Each year, the conference helps a small group of young programmers attend the conference. In exchange, the volunteers help the C++Now staff in running the conference.

Contributions to the Boost Scholarship Fund are earmarked* to support these programs and can be made in any amount, but specific benefits attach at certain sponsorship levels. Donations are made through Software Freedom Conservancy, a 501(c)3 not-for-profit charity and are fully tax-deductible to the extent permitted by law. Donors will receive a disclosure statement indicating the fair market value of any tangible benefits received.

**Are you a student who will volunteer in exchange for a ticket? Not a student, just want to volunteer?<br>[Learn how to apply to the Volunteer/Student Program](/about/student_volunteer_program/)**

All funds will, regardless of their use, be spent in a way that benefits the Boost community, the general public, and the advancement of free and open source software.</p>
