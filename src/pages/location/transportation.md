[Aspen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspen,_Colorado) is a compact town, and the [conference venue](http://www.aspenphys.org/) and [hotel](https://www.aspenmeadows.com/) are within walking distance of downtown shops and restaurants. However, for other transportation needs, there are several options.

## The Aspen Airport is Closed During C++Now 2022

The Aspen/Pitkin County Airport [has announced](https://pitkincounty.com/civicalerts.aspx?AID=465) that it will be closed during the first two weeks of May, 2022.

#### Options for getting into Aspen without going through ASE

* It is possible to rideshare or rent a car at Vail/Eagle (EGE). There are direct flights to EGE from ATL, DEN, DFW, EWT, IAH, JFK, LAX, LGA, MIA, ORD, PHL, PHX, and SFO. This drive is about eighty minutes.
* It is also possible to rideshare or rent a car at Grand Junction (GJT). There are direct flights to GJT from AZA, DEN, DFW, LAS, LAX, PHX, SNA. This drive is about one hundred thirty minutes.
* We also have attendees that choose to fly into Denver (DIA), rideshare or rent a car, and drive from there. This is about a four and a half hour drive.
* It is also possible to take public transportation from DIA to Aspen. This requires two transfers. Take the [train into Union Station, Denver](https://www.rtd-denver.com/), catch the [Bustang](https://ridebustang.com/) to Glenwood Springs, catch [RFTA](https://www.rfta.com/) into Aspen.
* A number of attendees drive from home. For some this is the best option.

### Public Transportation

Aspen's bus system is provided by the Roaring Fork Transportation Authority (RFTA) and serves routes throughout the town. The bus service within town is free. [View maps and schedules](https://www.rfta.com/) at the RFTA website.

[Bustang](https://ridebustang.com/) is a Colorado inter-city bus service.

### Aspen Meadows Shuttle

The [conference hotel](https://www.aspenmeadows.com/) provides a convenient, free shuttle into town that runs from 7 AM to 11 PM daily.

### Ridesharing

Some attendees elect to carpool from Denver (or other locations) to the conference location, and back again, reducing costs and making friends along the way! Check the up-to-date [carpool requests and availability document](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1izqsmyMEP86ard-wQjoPvdEepdHk2_I8k96O1XgcbZc) for listings. To make a request, or volunteer carpooling services, email [sharing@cppnow.org](mailto:sharing@cppnow.org).

Also, please join the discussion in the #rideshare-and-travel channel on the C++Now Discord. Here is the [invite link](https://discord.gg/UZWwKFa6rr).

### Bike Rental

[We-Cycle](https://www.we-cycle.org/) is available in Aspen. This system requires that you download an app to your smart phone and provide a credit card for security, but the first thirty minutes of every ride is free. Thirty minutes is usually enough for a trip anywhere is Aspen. The town of Aspen subsidizes this service to reduce parking in downtown Aspen.
