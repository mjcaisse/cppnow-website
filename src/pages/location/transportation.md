[Aspen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspen,_Colorado) is a compact town, and the [conference venue](http://www.aspenphys.org/) and [hotel](https://www.aspenmeadows.com/) are within walking distance of downtown shops and restaurants. However, for other transportation needs, there are several options.

### Public Transportation

Aspen's bus system is provided by the Roaring Fork Transportation Authority (RFTA) and serves routes throughout the town. The bus service within town is free. [View maps and schedules](https://www.rfta.com/) at the RFTA website.

### Aspen Meadows Shuttle

The [conference hotel](https://www.aspenmeadows.com/) provides a convenient, free shuttle into town that runs from 7 AM to 11 PM daily.

### Ride Sharing

Some attendees elect to carpool from Denver (or other locations) to the conference location, and back again, reducing costs and making friends along the way! Check the up-to-date [carpool requests and availability document](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1izqsmyMEP86ard-wQjoPvdEepdHk2_I8k96O1XgcbZc) for listings. To make a request, or volunteer carpooling services, email [sharing@cppnow.org](mailto:sharing@cppnow.org).

### Bike Rental

Bicycles are available for rent through the [Aspen Center for Physics](https://www.aspenphys.org/). The fee is $75 per week.

#### Picking up a Bike

1. Bikes are on the west side of Bethe Hall.
2. Pick out the bike you wish to use.
3. Note the number on the bar of the bike.

#### Bike Safety
