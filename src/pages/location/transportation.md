### C++Now {{site.current_year}}

Note: C++Now {{site.current_year}} will be <span style="color: red;">entirely online</span>.
{% else %}

[Aspen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspen,_Colorado) is a compact town, and the [conference venue](http://www.aspenphys.org/) and [hotel](https://www.aspenmeadows.com/) are within walking distance of downtown shops and restaurants. However, for other transportation needs, there are several options.

## The Aspen Airport is Closed During C++Now 2022

The Aspen/Pitkin County Airport [has announced](https://pitkincounty.com/civicalerts.aspx?AID=465) that it will be closed during the first two weeks of May, 2022, starting on May 2nd.

<span style="color:red;">You may need to make alternative transportation plans!<span>

#### Recommended solution: The "Boost Bus"
The airport doesn't shut down until Monday, which means that it is possible to fly into Aspen as normal. However, in order to see all available flights, it may be necessary to look for one-way, multi-city, or "hacker" fares.

**The conference is arranging a bus from Aspen to the Vail and Denver airports**. The *Boost Bus* will leave Aspen at 08:00 on Saturday with a stop at the Vail/Eagle (EGE) airport and final destination at the Denver International Airport (DEN). The fare for this trip will be $75, which you can pay as part of your registration.

The conference is providing this bus as a service to attendees, but cannot guarantee that the bus is large enough for all attendees that are not travelling by car. [Register](/registration/) as soon as possible to secure your seat on the bus.

Our recommendation for those flying in is:
* [Register](/registration/) as soon as possible to secure your seat on the *Boost Bus*.
* Make your [hotel](/location/lodging/) and travel arrangements as soon as possible to secure your Friday night stay and your flights into Aspen and out of either Vail/Eagle (EGE) or Denver International Airport (DEN).
* Fly into Aspen on Saturday or Sunday as normal.
* Plan to stay the night on Friday night.
* Take the *Boost Bus* to Vail/Eagle (EGE) or Denver International Airport (DEN) at 08:00 Saturday.
* Schedule an afternoon flight out of Vail/Eagle (EGE)  or a mid to late afternoon flight out of Denver International Airport (DEN).


#### Options for getting into and out of Aspen without going through ASE

* It is possible to rideshare or rent a car at Vail/Eagle (EGE). There are direct flights to EGE from ATL, DEN, DFW, EWT, IAH, JFK, LAX, LGA, MIA, ORD, PHL, PHX, and SFO. This drive is about eighty minutes.
* It is also possible to rideshare or rent a car at Grand Junction (GJT). There are direct flights to GJT from AZA, DEN, DFW, LAS, LAX, PHX, SNA. This drive is about one hundred thirty minutes.
* We also have attendees that choose to fly into Denver (DEN), rideshare or rent a car, and drive from there. This is about a four and a half hour drive.
* It is also possible to take public transportation from DEN to Aspen. This requires two transfers. Take the [train into Union Station, Denver](https://www.rtd-denver.com/), catch the [Bustang](https://ridebustang.com/) to Glenwood Springs, catch [RFTA](https://www.rfta.com/) into Aspen.
* A number of attendees drive from home. For some this is the best option.

### Public Transportation

Aspen's bus system is provided by the Roaring Fork Transportation Authority (RFTA) and serves routes throughout the town. The bus service within town is free. [View maps and schedules](https://www.rfta.com/) at the RFTA website.

[Bustang](https://ridebustang.com/) is a Colorado inter-city bus service.

### Aspen Meadows Shuttle

The [conference hotel](https://www.aspenmeadows.com/) provides a convenient, free shuttle into town that runs from 7 AM to 11 PM daily.

### Ridesharing

Some attendees elect to carpool from Denver (or other locations) to the conference location, and back again, reducing costs and making friends along the way! Check the up-to-date [carpool requests and availability document](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1izqsmyMEP86ard-wQjoPvdEepdHk2_I8k96O1XgcbZc) for listings. To make a request, or volunteer carpooling services, email [sharing@cppnow.org](mailto:sharing@cppnow.org).

Also, please join the discussion in the #rideshare-and-travel channel on the C++Now Discord. Here is the [invite link](https://discord.gg/UZWwKFa6rr).

### Bike Rental

[We-Cycle](https://www.we-cycle.org/) is available in Aspen. This system requires that you download an app to your smart phone and provide a credit card for security, but the first thirty minutes of every ride is free. Thirty minutes is usually enough for a trip anywhere in Aspen. The town of Aspen subsidizes this service to reduce parking in downtown Aspen.
