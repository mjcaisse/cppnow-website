[Aspen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspen,_Colorado) is a compact town, and the [conference venue](http://www.aspenphys.org/) and [hotel](https://www.aspenmeadows.com/) are within walking distance of downtown shops and restaurants. However, for other transportation needs, there are several options.

### Public Transportation

Aspen's bus system is provided by the Roaring Fork Transportation Authority (RFTA) and serves routes throughout the town. The bus service within town is free. [View maps and schedules](https://www.rfta.com/) at the RFTA website.

### Aspen Meadows Shuttle

The [conference hotel](https://www.aspenmeadows.com/) provides a convenient, free shuttle into town that runs from 7 AM to 11 PM daily.

### Ride Sharing

Some attendees elect to carpool from Denver (or other locations) to the conference location, and back again, reducing costs and making friends along the way! Check the up-to-date [carpool requests and availability document](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1izqsmyMEP86ard-wQjoPvdEepdHk2_I8k96O1XgcbZc) for listings. To make a request, or volunteer carpooling services, email [sharing@cppnow.org](mailto:sharing@cppnow.org).

### Bike Rental

[We-Cycle](https://www.we-cycle.org/) is available in Aspen. This system requires that you download an app to your smart phone and provide a credit card for security, but the first thirty minutes of every ride is free. Thirty minutes is usually enough for a trip anywhere is Aspen. The town of Aspen subsidizes this service to reduce parking in downtown Aspen.
