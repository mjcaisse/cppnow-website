## Individual Sponsors

For individuals, C++Now offers the Boost Scholarship Sponsorship in support of the Boost Scholarship Fund. [Corporate Sponsorships](/about/corporatesponsors/) are also available.

The Boost Scholarship Fund supports two programs that directly benefit C++ students and indirectly benefit the entire C++ community: Boost Summer of Code and the C++Now Student/Volunteer Program.


### Boost Summer of Code

The BSoC program is modeled after the [Google Summer of Code](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/) program, in which Boost is a long time participant. Like GSoC, BSoC projects provide funding for students to work on specific Boost Library projects over the summer. BSoC is designed to supplement the GSoC program by allowing Boost to accept students that would otherwise be rejected by GSoC due to funding or eligibility.



### C++Now Student/Volunteer Program

Each year, the conference helps a small group of young programmers attend the conference. In exchange, the volunteers help the C++Now staff in running the conference.
