# Welcome to Jekyll!
#
# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

# Status
## For items that are three phase (not yet, yet, not any more) we use these values:
#### "will", "is", "was"
## For items that are only two phase, we use Boolean values (false and true)

## becomes true on the last day of the conference

## Note that we "flip" the conference (set the current_year, etc,) when we make the
##  first post about the new conference. This *not* the "announce the date" post,
##  but is (usually) the CfS post.
